# ADO.NET Specification Tests

This library provides a suit of [xUnit.net](https://xunit.github.io/)-based tests for ADO.NET providers, i.e.,
classes that inherit from `DbConnection`, `DbCommand`, `DbDataReader`, etc.

It intends to clarify ambiguous areas in the ADO.NET documentation and help ensure that various providers act
consistently (when the behaviour doesn't depend on the specific target database server).

The results from the latest build are [published here](https://mysql-net.github.io/AdoNetResults/).

## How to Use

Add a reference to the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AdoNet.Specification.Tests) to your test project.

Create a class that implements `IDbFactoryFixture`: the
`Factory` property must return a `DbProviderFactory` for your ADO.NET implementation,
and the `ConnectionString` property must return a valid connection string that the test
suite can use to connect to a database. See
[this example](https://github.com/mysql-net/AdoNetApiTest/blob/master/tests/SqlClient.Tests/SqlClientDbFactoryFixture.cs) for
`System.Data.SqlClient`.

To use the tests that execute SQL statements, you must implement the `ISelectValueFixture`
interface. Examples of doing this can be found in the `tests/*` projects and `AdoNet.Databases`.

Create one public derived class from each `XTestBase<T>` test base class. Add a public
constructor that takes an instance of your `IDbFactoryFixture` implementation and passes it
to the base class.

As necessary, override failing test methods to customize/skip them for your provider.

See [Version History](VersionHistory.md).

## How to Build a Comparison Chart

Clone this repo.

Run the required database servers locally:

```
cd docker
docker compose up
```

Run the `AdoNetApiTest` program:

1. In Visual Studio 2017, set it as the Start Up Project and press `Ctrl+F5` to launch, or
2. From a command prompt: `dotnet run -p src\AdoNetApiTest\AdoNetApiTest.csproj`

Note that some DB providers require the full .NET Framework 4.7; this program has only been tested on Windows (not with mono).

The program will run all providers' test suites, then open the results in your default browser.
